# DBMS-Project

A database management system (DBMS) refers to the technology for creating and managing databases. Basically DBMS is a software tool to organize (create, retrieve, update and manage) data in a database.
    
    
The main aim of a DBMS is to supply a way to store up and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient. Hence our primary goal is store the data and monitor it and perform various operation on it. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have embedded meaning.
Data of particular can be gathered by RTO office database if we have vehicle number plate picture.
    
    
The project is aim at computerizing the manual process of fine collection of speed limit overruled vehicles on highways or roads from owner by sending penalty on their homes.
So basically there are some pathway or segments were vehicles have some speed limit to avoid the accident on roads. Area such as near villages, hospital, schooling areas. But some time people overruled the speed limit so their need a traffic police officer in collect penalty from car owner or bike rider. But this process is manually. Here we try to make their job easy and safe. Also there should need easily view notice board or sign for drivers so they carefully attention of speed limit ahead.


To achieve the easy way penalized system, the vehicle speed monitoring database management has following objectives:
•	Research on current method of fine collection.
•	Make penalty collection work easier and safer.
•	Effective system for traffic control.
•	A step for less accident or safe driving.
•	Time saving system for traffic officers.
